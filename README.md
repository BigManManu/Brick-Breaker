# Brick-Breaker
Brick Breaker game using Java. 
Features different difficulties, power ups, and ball physics determined by the parts of the paddle it hits.

From the Author:
"This was my attempt on improving the Java Brick Breaker game found in most YouTube tutorials 
by adding the features as mentioned above."

Noteable bugs to be fixed:
-Ball clips in the sides of the paddle 
-Ball can clip in the borders and get stuck, moving just up and down
